# Customer Retention & Personalization System (D2C)

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building a **real-world Customer Retention and Personalization system** using the **Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) database of Kerala Ayurveda**, developed during my internship.  
The system is designed as a **multi-stage production pipeline** to understand user behavior, predict retention, and personalize recommendations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
The system is structured across **three production phases**:

1. **User Return Prediction**  
   Predict whether a customer is likely to return in the future.

2. **Return Time Estimation**  
   Estimate the expected time window for the user’s next return.

3. **Product Category Recommendation**  
   Recommend the most probable product category based on user behavior and historical patterns.

## 🗂️ Data & Feature Engineering
- Worked with **raw relational D2C tables** containing user, session, product, and interaction-level data.
- Performed extensive **data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering** to build ML-ready datasets.
- Addressed real-world challenges including:
  - Feature dominance
  - Class imbalance
  - Noise in user behavior data
  - Overfitting in predictive models

---

## 🤖 Modeling & Pipeline
- Trained and evaluated **multiple machine learning models** for each phase of the pipeline.
- Achieved up to **92% prediction accuracy** across key tasks.
- Designed the system as a **production-ready ML pipeline**, ensuring modularity and scalability.

---

## 📈 Impact
- Improved **customer retention by 6.5%**
- Increased **funnel conversion rate by 1.6%**
- Enabled data-driven personalization for D2C users
